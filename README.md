<!-- This project involved building upon pre-laid-out code using HTML, CSS, and JS. Using all three, repairs must be made to a Password Generator.
When functioning properly, the Password Generator will produce a copyable custom line of text that fits the user's parameters.
Users are able to select the 'Uppercase', 'Lowercase', 'Numbers', and 'Symbols' parameters along with a password length between 8 and 128 characters.
The 'Generate Password' button's functionality is locked until at least one of the four parameter buttons have been selected.
Upon clicking, a 'Secure Password' is generated in the space at the bottom that matches the requested criteria! -->
This page is responsive to resizing and the code is well annotated.

This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JS files as well as all necessary images in the /assets/ folder.

All code written manually by Tyler Fruik
